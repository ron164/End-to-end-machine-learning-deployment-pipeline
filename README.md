# End-to-end-machine-learning-deployment-pipeline
This repository contains the end to end machine learning deployment pipeline i.e., from research environment to production environment.

Step by step approach from research environemnt to the production ready code which can be deployed is explained here.

### Step 1: Research environment: Performing EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Selection

### Step 2: Model Packaging: Developing python based ML-package, using this package for web-api developement.

### Step 3: Model Deployment: Deploying the microservices on the PaaS (Heroku).

### Step 4: Setting CI/CD pipeline: Setting up pipeline

### Step 5: Containerizing ML pipeline: Creating a Docker

### Step 6: Testing: Writing pytest
